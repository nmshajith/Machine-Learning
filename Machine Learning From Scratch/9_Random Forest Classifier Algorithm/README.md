This is ensemble of Decision Tree Algorithm
Where 'n' number of trees are created (Input n is provided by the user)
Each tree gets subset of X_train and y_train, with replacement as True (i.e) Same X_train vector can appear more than once also
Each of the tree performs Decision Tree algorithm
While predicting, the output from all the trees are taken, and the majority is given as the prediction
